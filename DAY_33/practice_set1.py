 Define property that should have the same value for every class instance
Define a class attribute”color” with a default value white. I.e., Every Vehicle should be white.

Use the following code for this exercise.
class Vehicle:

    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    pass

Expected Output:

Color: White, Vehicle name: School Volvo, Speed: 180, Mileage: 12
Color: White, Vehicle name: Audi Q5, Speed: 240, Mileage: 18

Write a function that returns True if a dictionary contains the specified key, and False otherwise.

Examples
has_key({ "a": 44, "b": 45, "c": 46 }, "d") ➞ False

has_key({ "craves": True, "midnight": True, "snack": True }, "morning") ➞ False

has_key({ "pot": 1, "tot": 2, "not": 3 }, "not") ➞ True

Class Inheritance
Given:

Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.

Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500. You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.

Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class. We need to access the parent class from inside a method of a child class.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
        self.name = name
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.capacity = capacity

    def fare(self):
        return self.capacity * 100

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 12, 50)
print("Total Bus fare is:", School_bus.fare())

Expected Output:

Total Bus fare is: 5500.0
